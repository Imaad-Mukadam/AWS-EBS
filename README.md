# AWS-EBS

## Summary 

### **Attaching an EBS Volume to an Existing EC2 Instance**  

This project demonstrates how to create an **Elastic Block Store (EBS)** volume and attach it to an existing **EC2 instance** for additional storage. The volume is formatted and mounted for immediate use.  

#### **Steps:**  
‚úÖ **Create an EBS Volume** ‚Äì Specify the size, type, and availability zone matching the EC2 instance.  
‚úÖ **Attach the Volume** ‚Äì Link the EBS volume to the target EC2 instance.  
‚úÖ **Format the Volume** ‚Äì If new, format it to a compatible file system (e.g., ext4 for Linux).  
‚úÖ **Mount the Volume** ‚Äì Attach it to a directory for storage access.  

#### **Example Commands (Linux):**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **List available disks**  
```bash
lsblk
```

Important Points:

‚ö†Ô∏è EBS is region-specific ‚Äì The EBS volume must be in the same AWS region as the target EC2 instance.

‚ö†Ô∏è EBS is AZ-specific ‚Äì The volume must also be in the same Availability Zone (AZ) as the EC2 instance.

‚ö†Ô∏è Data Persistence ‚Äì EBS retains data even if detached, but deleting the volume is permanent unless backed up.

This setup extends EC2 storage without data loss or downtime. üöÄ
